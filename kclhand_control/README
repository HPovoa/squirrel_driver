# For the KCL hand 

# Create the udev rules to allow to run the hand controllers without root permission
# Go to the /udev folder, Either call the script create_udev_rules or use the following commands:
# sudo cp metahand_usb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
# sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart

# Control the Metahand
# The Metahand is controlled though ROS services, so use service calls to run the hand
# Here are the several functions

# 1. Hand control via state machine 
# rosservice call /hand_operation_mode "operation_mode: mode_id"
# mode_id = 0, disable all motors
# mode_id = 1, enable all motors
# mode_id = 2, close the hand for a grasping action
# mode_id = 3, swich hand configuration from the upper workspace to lower workspace
# mode_id = 4, swich hand configuration from the lower workspace to upper workspace

# 2. Finger position control
# rosservice call /move_finger

# 3. Hand position control
# rosservice call /move_hand
