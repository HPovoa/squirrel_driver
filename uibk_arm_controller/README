how to install:

dependencies: geometry_msgs roscpp std_msgs control_toolbox sensor_msgs

running it: roslaunch uibk_arm_controller controller.launch 2> /dev/null

topics:

/real/robotino_arm/joint_control/get_max_dist_per_cycle std_msgs/Float64: publishes the velolicity limit
/real/robotino_arm/joint_control/get_state sensor_msgs/JointState: publishes the joint state (6dof) including the base rotation
/real/robotino_arm/joint_control/move std_msgs/Float64MultiArray: subscribes to position commands (6dof) per clock cycle. needs to be in mode 10 or 30 in order to actually move the robot
/real/robotino_arm/settings/get_clock_cycle std_msgs/Float64: publishes the cycle time in seconds. the standard value is 0.0125
/real/robotino_arm/settings/get_command_state std_msgs/Float32MultiArray: publishes pair of two values (first one is the current mode (0, 10 or 30). the second I can't remember right now
/real/robotino_arm/settings/switch_mode std_msgs/Int32: listens for mode switching. the available modes are 0, 10 and 30
